## ▶️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NahidCSERU/30-Days-Linux-for-DevOps-Challenge.git
   cd day02-file-operations/scripts
    ``` 
2. Make scripts executable:   
`chmod +x *.sh`  

3. Run examples:   
    ```bash

## 📝 Notes  
* Use `ls -l` to see file permissions, owners, and sizes.

* Be careful with `rm -r` because it permanently deletes files.

* `cp -r` is required when copying directories.

* `mv` can rename a file or move it to another directory.
