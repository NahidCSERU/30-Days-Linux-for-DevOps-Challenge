# Day 8: Processes (ps, top, htop)

This project demonstrates process management in Linux using **ps**, **top**, and **htop** commands.  
Includes custom bash scripts to monitor CPU, Memory usage, and process counts.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- `ps-script.sh` â†’ Examples of using `ps`
- `top-script.sh` â†’ Running `top` in batch mode
- `htop-script.sh` â†’ Interactive `htop` usage
- `process-monitor.sh` â†’ Custom process monitoring tool

## ðŸš€ Usage

### Make scripts executable
```
chmod +x *.sh
```
### Run ps demo
```
./ps-script.sh
```
### Run top demo
