# Day 24: Log Parsing with grep, awk, sed

This project demonstrates **log parsing techniques** using Bash scripting with `grep`, `awk`, and `sed`.

## 🔹 What You Will Learn
- Extract specific patterns from logs using `grep`
- Analyze and format logs with `awk`
- Clean and transform logs with `sed`

## 🛠️ Run
```
chmod +x scripts/parse_logs.sh
./scripts/parse_logs.sh
```
## 📂 Example Log File

`logs/sample.log` contains dummy Apache/Nginx-style logs for parsing practice.

## 🧹 Cleanup

Just delete the logs if needed:
```
rm -rf logs/*
```
